# What I Learned About Linux Commands Today

ðŸ“… Date: September 17, 2025

Today I practiced some basic Linux commands inside my Kali VM. These are the key takeaways:

## 1. Navigation Commands
- `pwd` â†’ Prints the current working directory. Helpful to always know where I am.
- `ls` â†’ Lists files and folders. Adding `-l` shows details, and `-a` includes hidden files.
- `cd <directory>` â†’ Changes the current directory. Using `cd ..` moves up one folder.

## 2. File Management
- `touch file.txt` â†’ Creates an empty file.
- `mkdir test_folder` â†’ Makes a new directory.
- `rm file.txt` â†’ Deletes a file. **Be careful!**
- `rm -r folder/` â†’ Deletes a folder and everything inside it.

## 3. Viewing Content
- `cat file.txt` â†’ Displays the contents of a file.
- `less file.txt` â†’ Lets me scroll through long files.
- `head -n 5 file.txt` â†’ Shows the first 5 lines of a file.
- `tail -n 5 file.txt` â†’ Shows the last 5 lines of a file.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Reflection
Today I learned that Linux commands are very powerful but also dangerous if used incorrectly (like `rm -r`). Iâ€™m starting to get comfortable with navigation and file management. My next step is to practice permissions commands like `chmod` and `chown`.
