# Foundations of Cybersecurity ‚Äì Notes

## Module 1: Welcome to the World of Cybersecurity

### What Cybersecurity Is
- Cybersecurity = protecting devices, networks, data, and systems from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access.
- Focuses on the CIA Triad:
  - **Confidentiality**: Keeping data secret.
  - **Integrity**: Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered.
  - **Availability**: Making sure systems and data are accessible when needed.

### What Cybersecurity Professionals Do
- Monitor networks and systems for suspicious activity.
- Respond to incidents and contain threats.
- Assess vulnerabilities and apply patches.
- Develop and enforce security policies.
- Train users on safe practices.

### Skills Needed
- **Technical:** Networking, operating systems, scripting, SIEM tools.
- **Non-technical:** Communication, problem solving, critical thinking, teamwork.

### Entry-Level Roles
- SOC Analyst (Security Operations Center)
- Security Support Specialist
- Incident Response Technician
- Cyber Defense Analyst

### üìä Quiz Tips & Common Questions
- Q: What is the CIA Triad?  
  A: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability ‚Äî the three core goals of cybersecurity.  
- Q: Name two technical and two non-technical skills needed in cybersecurity.  
  A: Technical: Networking, scripting; Non-technical: Communication, problem solving.  
- Q: What is a SOC Analyst responsible for?  
  A: Monitoring systems for threats, responding to incidents, and documenting events.  
- Q: Scenario: A company has sensitive client data and wants to ensure it is not altered or stolen. Which CIA principles are most relevant?  
  A: **Confidentiality** and **Integrity**.

## Module 2: The Evolution of Cybersecurity

### History
- Early attacks were mostly pranks or viruses.
- Modern attacks are complex, targeted, and often financially motivated.
- Growth of cloud, IoT, and connected devices expanded the attack surface.

### Common Attack Types
- **Phishing** ‚Äì Fake messages trick users into revealing info.
- **Malware** ‚Äì Malicious software like viruses, worms, ransomware.
- **DoS/DDoS** ‚Äì Flooding systems with traffic to make them unavailable.
- **SQL Injection** ‚Äì Inserting malicious queries into databases.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** ‚Äì Intercepting communication between two parties.

### Security Domains (High-Level)
- Risk Management
- Asset Security
- Security Engineering
- Communications & Network Security
- Identity & Access Management
- Security Assessment & Testing
- Security Operations
- Software Development Security

### üìä Quiz Tips & Common Questions
- Q: Name three types of malware.  
  A: Virus, Worm, Ransomware (also Trojan, Spyware).  
- Q: What is a DoS attack?  
  A: Denial of Service ‚Äì flooding a system to make it unavailable to legitimate users.  
- Q: Scenario: An attacker intercepts messages between two employees to steal data. Which attack type is this?  
  A: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM).  
- Q: List two security domains.  
  A: Example: Risk Management, Asset Security.

## Module 3: Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

### Key Terms
- **Threat:** Potential cause of harm (e.g., malware, attacker).  
- **Vulnerability:** A weakness that can be exploited.  
- **Exploit:** The act of using a vulnerability.  
- **Risk:** Likelihood a threat exploits a vulnerability and the resulting impact.

### CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** ‚Äì Protect data from unauthorized access.  
- **Integrity** ‚Äì Ensure data remains accurate and unchanged.  
- **Availability** ‚Äì Keep data and systems accessible when needed.

### Security Controls
- **Preventive:** Firewalls, access control, training.  
- **Detective:** SIEM monitoring, IDS/IPS, logging.  
- **Corrective:** Backups, patching, incident response.

### Frameworks & Principles
- **NIST Framework:** Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.  
- **Least Privilege:** Give users only the access they need.  
- **Defense in Depth:** Use multiple layers of security.  
- **Zero Trust:** Never trust by default, always verify.

### Ethics
- Always follow laws and respect privacy.  
- Unauthorized testing or hacking is illegal without permission.

### üìä Quiz Tips & Common Questions
- Q: Define vulnerability and exploit.  
  A: Vulnerability = weakness in a system; Exploit = using that weakness to attack.  
- Q: What are the three types of security controls?  
  A: Preventive, Detective, Corrective.  
- Q: Scenario: A user clicks a phishing email and malware installs itself. Which two terms describe this situation?  
  A: Threat (malware) and Exploit (phishing email).  
- Q: What does ‚ÄúLeast Privilege‚Äù mean?  
  A: Users get only the access they need to do their job.

## Module 4: Cybersecurity Tools & Programming

### Common Tools
- **SIEM:** Splunk, Wazuh ‚Äì collect and analyze logs for threats.  
- **Network Analysis:** Wireshark, Nmap ‚Äì scan and monitor network traffic.  
- **Endpoint Security:** Antivirus, EDR ‚Äì protect devices from malware and threats.

### Linux Basics
- Common commands: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, `chmod`, `grep`  
- Used for managing servers, analyzing logs, and automation.

### SQL Basics
- Used to query databases for anomalies and investigations.  
- Example:  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM logs WHERE status='failed';
