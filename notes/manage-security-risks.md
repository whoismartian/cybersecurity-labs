# Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks â€“ Notes

## Module 1: Introduction to Risk Management

### What is Risk Management?
- Risk management = identifying, assessing, and controlling threats to digital assets.
- Goal: **reduce risk** to an acceptable level, not eliminate it completely.

### Key Terms
- **Asset:** Anything valuable to an organization (data, hardware, people, etc.).
- **Threat:** Potential event that can harm an asset.
- **Vulnerability:** A weakness that could be exploited by a threat.
- **Exploit:** The method used to take advantage of a vulnerability.
- **Risk:** Chance that a threat will exploit a vulnerability and the resulting impact.

### Risk Formula
- **Risk = Likelihood Ã— Impact**
- High likelihood + high impact = critical risk

### Risk Management Process
1. Identify assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
2. Assess likelihood and impact
3. Prioritize risks
4. Treat risks using controls
5. Monitor and update regularly

### ðŸ“Š Quiz Tips & Common Questions
- Q: Define risk, threat, and vulnerability.  
  A: Risk = likelihood Ã— impact; Threat = potential cause of harm; Vulnerability = weakness that can be exploited.  
- Q: Scenario: A company stores sensitive client data. A known software flaw could allow unauthorized access. What is the risk formula?  
  A: Likelihood of exploit Ã— impact on data.  
- Q: Name the steps in the risk management process.  
  A: Identify, Assess, Prioritize, Treat, Monitor.

## Module 2: Frameworks, Policies, and Standards

### Frameworks
- Provide structured guidance for managing risk.
- Examples:
  - **NIST CSF:** Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
  - **ISO/IEC 27001:** International info security standard
  - **CIS Controls:** 18 prioritized best practices

### Security Policies
- Define organizational security requirements.
- Examples:
  - Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)  
  - Access Control Policy  
  - Incident Response Policy

### Standards and Regulations
- Ensure legal and industry compliance.
- Examples:
  - GDPR â€“ EU data privacy  
  - HIPAA â€“ US health info security  
  - PCI DSS â€“ payment card industry standard

### ðŸ“Š Quiz Tips & Common Questions
- Q: Name one security framework and its purpose.  
  A: NIST CSF â€“ guides organizations in managing cybersecurity risk.  
- Q: Scenario: Your company handles credit card info. Which standard is most relevant?  
  A: PCI DSS.  
- Q: Give an example of a security policy.  
  A: Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).

## Module 3: Managing and Responding to Risk

### Risk Treatment Options
1. **Avoid** â€“ eliminate risky activity  
2. **Transfer** â€“ shift risk (insurance, outsourcing)  
3. **Mitigate** â€“ reduce likelihood or impact  
4. **Accept** â€“ acknowledge risk and continue operations

### Security Controls
- Preventive: Firewalls, MFA, encryption  
- Detective: IDS, SIEM, monitoring  
- Corrective: Patching, backups, incident response

### Risk Register
- Tracks risks and how they are managed  
- Fields: Description, Likelihood & Impact, Score, Mitigation Plan, Status/Owner

### Residual Risk
- Risk remaining after controls are applied

### ðŸ“Š Quiz Tips & Common Questions
- Q: List the four risk treatment options.  
  A: Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, Accept.  
- Q: Scenario: A business cannot eliminate a risk but implements monitoring to detect incidents. What treatment is this?  
  A: Mitigate.  
- Q: What is a risk register?  
  A: A document tracking risks, severity, and mitigation.

## Module 4: Incident Response and Business Continuity

### Incident Response (IR)
- Structured approach to handling security incidents
- Phases:
  1. Preparation â€“ Train team, define procedures  
  2. Identification â€“ Detect and confirm incidents  
  3. Containment â€“ Stop spread / limit damage  
  4. Eradication â€“ Remove threat  
  5. Recovery â€“ Restore systems and operations  
  6. Lessons Learned â€“ Review and improve

### Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery
- **BCP:** Ensure critical operations continue during disruptions  
- **DRP:** Procedures for restoring systems after a major event

### Communication During Incidents
- Internal: Clear communication speeds response  
- External: Pre-defined protocols for customers, regulators, media

### ðŸ“Š Quiz Tips & Common Questions
- Q: Name the six phases of incident response.  
  A: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned.  
- Q: Scenario: A ransomware attack shuts down company systems. Which plan is most important for restoring operations?  
  A: Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP).  
- Q: What is the difference between BCP and DRP?  
  A: BCP ensures critical operations continue; DRP restores systems after a disruption.

## Key Takeaways
- Risk management reduces risk to an acceptable level, using frameworks, policies, and controls.  
- Risk registers and documentation are essential for tracking and managing threats.  
- Incident response and business continuity plans minimize damage and recovery time.  
- Scenario-based understanding prepares you for both quizzes and real-world cybersecurity tasks.
