# Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks – Notes

## Module 1: Introduction to Risk Management

### What is Risk Management?
- **Risk management** is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling threats to an organization's digital assets.
- The goal is to **reduce risk** to an acceptable level — not eliminate it completely.

### Key Terms
- **Asset:** Anything valuable to an organization (data, hardware, people, etc.).
- **Threat:** A potential event that can harm an asset.
- **Vulnerability:** A weakness that could be exploited by a threat.
- **Exploit:** The method used to take advantage of a vulnerability.
- **Risk:** The chance that a threat will exploit a vulnerability and the resulting impact.

### Risk Formula
- **Risk = Likelihood × Impact**
- Example: If a vulnerability is easy to exploit (high likelihood) and would cause major damage (high impact), the risk is critical.

### Risk Management Process
1. **Identify** assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.
2. **Assess** the likelihood and impact of each risk.
3. **Prioritize** risks based on severity.
4. **Treat** risks using security controls.
5. **Monitor** and update risk assessments regularly.

## Module 2: Frameworks, Policies, and Standards

### Frameworks
- Provide structured guidance for managing security risks.
- Common frameworks:
  - **NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework):** Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
  - **ISO/IEC 27001:** International standard for information security management
  - **CIS Controls:** 18 prioritized security best practices

### Security Policies
- Formal documents that define an organization’s security requirements and expectations.
- Examples:
  - **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):** How company resources can and cannot be used.
  - **Access Control Policy:** Rules for who gets access to what.
  - **Incident Response Policy:** Steps for handling security incidents.

### Standards and Regulations
- Ensure organizations meet industry/legal requirements.
- Examples:
  - **GDPR:** Data privacy regulation (EU)
  - **HIPAA:** Health information security (U.S.)
  - **PCI DSS:** Payment card industry standards

## Module 3: Managing and Responding to Risk

### Risk Treatment Options
1. **Avoid** – Eliminate the activity causing the risk.
2. **Transfer** – Shift the risk to another party (e.g., insurance, outsourcing).
3. **Mitigate** – Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact.
4. **Accept** – Acknowledge the risk and continue operations.

### Security Controls
- **Preventive:** Firewalls, MFA, encryption.
- **Detective:** Intrusion detection systems (IDS), log monitoring.
- **Corrective:** Patching, backups, incident response.

### Risk Register
- A document that tracks risks and how they are managed.
- Common fields:
  - Risk description
  - Likelihood & impact
  - Risk score
  - Mitigation plan
  - Status / owner

### Residual Risk
- The amount of risk left after controls are applied.
- Always exists — cannot reduce risk to zero.

## Module 4: Incident Response and Business Continuity

### Incident Response (IR)
- A structured approach to handling security incidents.
- Typical IR Phases:
  1. **Preparation:** Train team, define procedures.
  2. **Identification:** Detect and confirm incidents.
  3. **Containment:** Stop the spread or limit damage.
  4. **Eradication:** Remove the threat.
  5. **Recovery:** Restore systems and operations.
  6. **Lessons Learned:** Review and improve.

### Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery
- **Business Continuity Plan (BCP):** Ensures critical operations continue during disruptions.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):** Procedures for restoring systems after a major event.

### Communication During Incidents
- Clear internal communication reduces confusion and speeds up response.
- External communication (customers, regulators, media) should follow pre-defined protocols.

## Key Takeaways
- Risk management is about **reducing threats** to an acceptable level, not eliminating them completely.
- Frameworks, policies, and regulations guide organizations in managing risk consistently.
- Always **document risks** and responses — the risk register is your single source of truth.
- Incident response and business continuity planning are critical for minimizing damage and recovery time.
- Continuous monitoring and improvement keep defenses strong over time.
